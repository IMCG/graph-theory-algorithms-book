\Input{A weighted digraph $G = (V, E)$ that has no
  self-loops. Negative edge weights are allowed. The order of $G$ is
  $n > 0$. Vertices are numbered from 1 to $n$, i.e.
  $V = \{1, 2, \dots, n\}$. The weight matrix $W = [w(i,j)]$ of $G$ as
  defined in~(\ref{eqn:graph_algorithms:Floyd_Roy_Warshall_weight_matrix}).}
\Output{A matrix $P = [a_{ij}]$ of shortest paths in $G$. A matrix
  $D = [a_{ij}]$ of distances where $D[i,j]$ is the weight~(or
  distance) of a shortest $i$-$j$ path in $G$.}

A GNU-FDL [1] book on algorithmic graph theory by David Joyner [2],
Minh Van Nguyen [3], and Nathann Cohen [4]. This is an introductory
book on algorithmic graph theory. Theory and algorithms are
illustrated using the Sage [5] open source mathematics software. See
the file LICENSE for the licensing terms of the book.

The book is written using LaTeX [6] and TikZ/PGF [7]. It uses
Mercurial [8] as its version control system. To clone the latest
revision of the book, ensure you have Mercurial installed on your
system. Then issue any of the following commands from your command
line:

$ hg clone https://graph-theory-algorithms-book.googlecode.com/hg/ graph-theory
$ hg clone http://graph-theory-algorithms-book.googlecode.com/hg/ graph-theory

To compile a PDF version of the book, run the command

$ make

To delete junk files resulting from the compilation process, run

$ make clean

In fact, a successful compilation should automatically delete any junk
files resulting from the compilation process. The file util.sh is a script
that interfaces with utilities under the directory bin/.


FAQ
===

(1) Question: I'm getting error messages to the following effect when
    compiling the book:

    ! TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [main memory size=3000000].

    What's going on?

    Answer: This might mean that you need to increase TeX's main memory
    because the book uses pgfplots for generating plots of large datasets. To
    increase TeX's main memory, you need to locate the active texmf.cnf file
    for your TeX/LaTeX distribution. For example, on Ubuntu you can do so via
    the command

    $ kpsewhich texmf.cnf

    Then open the file as root with the command

    $ sudo emacs /usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf

    which will most likely prompt you for an administrator password. Enter the
    password and search for the line that begins with something such as

    main_memory = 3000000 % words of inimemory available; also applies to inimf&mp

    Change the value "3000000" to "10000000", i.e. change from 3 million to
    10 million. Save your edit and quit your editor. Then issue the command

    $ sudo fmtutil-sys --all

    and compile the book again.
